Hello, and welcome to Intermediate SQL. My name is Mona Khalil. I am a Curriculum Lead with DataCamp, and I will be your instructor for this course.

SQL, or structured query language, is a powerful tool for working with relational databases. With an intermediate knowledge of SQL, you will gain the ability to shape, transform, and manipulate data from multiple tables in a relational database to answer a robust set of data science questions.


---
## Topics covered:

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "58ec1d3eb9"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- CASE / CASE WHEN statements
- Simple subqueries
- Correlated subqueries
- Window functions (OVER, PARTITION BY, UNBOUNDED PRECEDING, UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING, CURRENT ROW)


`@script`
In this course, you will learn how to shape, transform, and manipulate data using (1) the CASE function, (2) simple subqueries, (3) correlated subqueries, and (4) window functions.

## Prerequisites

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "5c4ffd2886"
```

`@part1`
- Intro to SQL for Data Science
```SQL 
SELECT user_id, SUM(sales) 
FROM sales_data
WHERE user_id BETWEEN 300 AND 400
GROUP BY user_id;
```


`@part2`
- Joining Tables in PostgreSQL
```SQL
SELECT c.country, c.team, sum(m.goals)
FROM countries AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.team_id = m.home_team_id
WHERE m.year > 1990
GROUP BY c.country, c.team
```


`@script`
Before taking this course, you should be comfortable working with the topics covered in our Intro to SQL for Data Science course, such as SELECT statements that include arithmetic functions, GROUP BY functions, and use WHERE clauses to filter data. 

You should also be familiar with concepts discussed in the Joining Tables in PostgreSQL, such as the LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, INNER and OUTER joins. In Intermediate SQL, we will be building upon many topics discussed during that course.

## CASE and CASE WHEN

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "9bd5950c69"
```

`@part1`
```SQL
SELECT
```


`@script`
The first topic you will learn in this course is CASE statements. CASE statements are a simplified means of testing multiple logical conditions and returning a single value for a row. For example,
